# Advanced SQL Joins – Airbnb Database

This directory contains advanced SQL queries demonstrating the use of INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN on a simulated Airbnb database.

**Queries included:**
1. INNER JOIN: Bookings and their users.
2. LEFT JOIN: Properties and their reviews (including properties without reviews).
3. FULL OUTER JOIN: All users and all bookings, covering cases where users may not have bookings and bookings may not be linked to users.

See `joins_queries.sql` for all queries.


# Advanced SQL Practice – Subqueries

This directory contains advanced SQL queries for practicing the use of both correlated and non-correlated subqueries on a simulated Airbnb database.

**Included queries:**
1. Find all properties with an average rating greater than 4.0 (non-correlated subquery).
2. Find users who have made more than 3 bookings (correlated subquery).

See `subqueries.sql` for the actual SQL code.
